			   Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
			   the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of 
			   type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but 
			   also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
                the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
			   with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
                Why do we use it?
				It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
				 content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum 
				 is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
				 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop 
				 publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
				 text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy
				 . Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes 
				 on purpose (injected humour and the like).
